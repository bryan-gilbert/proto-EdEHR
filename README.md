## EHR generation
The EHR side of the project contains almost 40 separate screens, each needs to be in the menu and routing tables.  These tasks are automated via a script in the makeEhr subdirectory.
This script only needs to be invoked if the content of the configuration files have been 
modified.  The source of the configuration files comes from a Google spreadsheet stored in the project GDrive. 
```
cd makeEhr
./deploy.sh
```
