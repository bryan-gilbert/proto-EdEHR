Title: EdEHR  
Author: Bryan Gilbert

Ability to compose high level lists and quickly dive into the details.

Able to share across many machines by a single user.

Able to publish to a form that others can use and understand (nice clean visuals)

Review and understand the medical fields that form the case.  What types of data are provided by the case (Seed). What types of data must the student enter. How may times during a case (assignment).

Develop the preliminary technical architecture plans.

For each technology area list

* why it is needed, what function does it provide
* what requirements must it meet
* what requirements does it not need to achieve (noting that nothing is black and while. This is just a “in general for this project we don’t need XYZ”
* list the main contending software options
* give a pros and cons  for each
* declare the leading candidate technologies and why
* link to any supporting information regarding how to use and setup
