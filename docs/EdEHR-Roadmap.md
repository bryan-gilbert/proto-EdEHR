Title: EdEHR  
Author: Bryan Gilbert

This document is my catch all project management and conceptualizing and scratch pad.

By using Scrivener I  have:

* Ability to compose high level lists and quickly dive into the details.
* Able to share across many machines by a single user.
* Add metadata to track status and dates
* Able to publish to a form that others can use and understand (nice clean visuals)

*December 18, 2013*

*Next month, Simon Fraser University will complete its switch to Canvas---a new learning management system (LMS) used as a stand-alone platform by only one other post-secondary institution in Canada.*

*...*

*While Canvas is an open source, easy-to-use, cloud-native LMS, the university will host Canvas locally; that is, on servers physically located at SFU.*

## Grading ##
<a href="#toc">Top</a>

Amanda found this link to a video showing how instructors may grade assignments in Canvas.

<https://community.canvaslms.com/videos/1119-speedgrader-overview-instructors>

For instructors to benefit from this feature there needs to be some way for the EdEHR application to share something that can be displayed inside the Canvas app’s grading system.  Essentially, EdEHR would need to send some form of document, via LTI, to the LTI consumer that can be used for grading.


1\. Can a LTI provider send documents to the LTI consumer for evaluation. 

2\. If ‘yes’ then what formats can they take.  

3\. If ‘yes’ then, can EdEHR produce this format?

Tuesday Sept 11^th^ 1:00 to 1:30

Developed high level view of how the app works. Identified three layers: 

1\. Learning Management System 

2\. Assignment management system

3\. Electronic Health Record system

Moodle as possible container for EdEHR and replace need for us to build LMS functionality.

Found Blackboard

Found Canvas

Discovered ComPAIR

ComPAIR

See notes in Technical Architecture and

<https://ctlt.ubc.ca/about/contact-us/teaching-learning-technologies/>

<https://lthub.ubc.ca/guides/compair/>

Made several attempts to get IMS to share a copy of the LTI spec

Drafted a preliminary ERD

Review and understand the medical fields that form the case.  What types of data are provided by the case (Seed). What types of data must the student enter. How may times during a case (assignment). 

\- reviewing the documented requirements and wireframes in order to create an entity relationship diagram that supports the EHR teaching & learning activities

Develop the preliminary technical architecture plans.

\- developing a technical architecture proposal (based on LTI)

\- technologies used for development & deployment (e.g., programming languages, application server requirements, database server requirements, etc)


For each technology area list

* why it is needed, what function does it provide
* what requirements must it meet
* what requirements does it not need to achieve (noting that nothing is black and while. This is just a “in general for this project we don’t need XYZ”
* list the main contending software options
* give a pros and cons  for each
* declare the leading candidate technologies and why
* link to any supporting information regarding how to use and setup

**ERD**

Create an entity relationship diagram that illustrates the structure of the application.

<https://www.draw.io/#G1BFLNrE9vh4XDUoLbg_gz_g0-LNmU7P_I>

\- relationships with system and other technologies (e.g., provisioning and authentication strategies, interconnections between LMS system (if applicable)

\- at a very high level, what information is passed around and how

\- a schematic diagram can help to articulate this

## Sept 24 - 28 ##
<a href="#toc">Top</a>

LTI Spec

Contact IMS Global and get a copy of the spec.

Setup Mongo and mongoose

Compose some unit tests to generate the db, add a table, add some rows, remove rows, update existing data, generate 10,000 records, search those records, etc

**Canvas**

**WIP**

Setup Canvas locally and explore the application looking for how it can be used to supply the LMS side our EdEHR
