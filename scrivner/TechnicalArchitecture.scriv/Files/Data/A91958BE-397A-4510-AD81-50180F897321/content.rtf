\f0\fs26 \cf0 About the EdEHR project\
BCcampus is leading the development of a new educational technology for the classroom in the Educational Electronic Health Record System Project (EdEHR). This project is funded by the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training and will build on existing research and development completed by an interest group from BCIT, Douglas College, UBC, and UVic.\
In support of the requirement for health professional graduates to be competent in using electronic health records in an inter-professional setting, the goal of this project is to develop a solution that can be piloted and evaluated by interested institutions.\
