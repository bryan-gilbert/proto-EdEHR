\f0\fs26 \cf0 Use Trello as agile team communication tool.  Put all main high level tasks in Trello as placeholders for future work. Keep these simple as they just illustrate the big picture.  Put all immediate tasks in Trello.  These are small achievable tasks that are planned for the next sprint or two or are actually in progress.  This keeps the Trello board focused on sharing with the team what are current activities and near term plans.}
